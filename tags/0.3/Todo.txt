Todo:

Add a pencil solving option.  Perhaps don't check penciled in squares.

Options dialog:
    Add a clue number color and font option (currently they're set to whatever
    the pen is set to).

Convert dialog:
    Perhaps add an option to scramble when outputting a .puz file.

    Add an output format column.

Attempt to load a puzzle with each handler until one succeeds or all fail.

Set a minimum zoom.

Set a realistic minimum clue number font size.

Stripping the (c) symbol when saving as text format doesn't work under Ubuntu.

Consider anti-aliased drawing for the grid (wxGCDC).

Sometimes the clue prompt doesn't pick the best wrap (i.e. it picks a wrapping
    that uses a smaller font size than it could).

(12/4/09) I got a failed ASSERT (IsValidString) while loading a puz file
    (nyt090304).
    This is because of a rebus entry "IN/OUT"  It doesn't like the slash.
    Perhaps we could use a slash as a way to split different across/down
    entries.

Add diagramless solving.  Allow black squares to be focused, and use the
    spacebar to toggle black / white squares.

          (These should assume good checksums . . .)
        - Broken version string

        - Poorly formed sections
        - Missing nul-terminators (many places for this)
