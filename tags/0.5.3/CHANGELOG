Version 0.4 development
=======================
New Features
------------
* Embedded lua for scripting.  Included scripts:
    * Puzzle downloading
    * Puzzle database
    * "Swap across and down" written in lua
    * OneAcross.com search
    * Wikipedia.com search
    * Non-native file import
    * Try all letters (A-Z) in a blank square of the current word.

* User is now prompted before revealing the entire grid.
* Shift+8 (asterisk) toggles a circle in the current square.
* Check / Reveal can use a user-defined selection of squares.

Bug Fixes
---------
* .puz files now correctly use the full Windows-1252 code page instead of
  latin 1.
* Fixed a bug with obscure rebus entry behavior resulting in incorrectly
  reported solved / unsolved puzzles.
* "Move to next blank" will now wrap to the first blank in the word if the
  last blank has been entered (i.e. A-A-T; the user enters "I" as the 4th
  letter, and the cursor moves to the second letter).
* Spacebar always deletes the current letter and moves to the next square
  regardless of preferences.
* XWord correctly loads puzzles using webdings for rebus entries (entering
  webdings symbols in the grid is not currently supported, though XWord
  can display symbols in a puzzle previously saved by Across Lite).

Misc
----
* Revamped build system using premake4 to generate platform-specific
  project files and makefiles.
  Projects for MSVC2006, and MSVC2008.
  Makefile for linux.
* Removed conversion dialog.


----------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.3.1 (12/11/2009)
==========================
* Fixed "Move to next blank" bug (really, this time I mean it)


----------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.3 (12/11/2009)
========================
New Features
------------
* If a puzzle file is corrupt and not entirely unrecoverable, an option is
  given to load the puzzle anyway.
* A dialog supporting batch conversion of puzzle files (from .txt to .puz
  and vice-versa) has been added under the tools menu.  If the
  -convert [-c] command line option is given when XWord is invoked, only
  the conversion dialog appears.  Closing the dialog ends the program.
  Files to convert can still be given as command line parameters, and other
  options (-directory [-d], -output-files [-o], -overwrite [-w]) work as
  expected. If XWord is invoked with -c, conversion begins immediately.
* Added a clue prompt format preference.
* Added separate preferences for grid clue number and text fonts.
* Added an option to tweak the proprtion of text size to clue number size
  in the grid.
* Rudimentary printing.
* Added "Swap across and down" under the tools menu for a new perspective
  on your crossword puzzle!

Bug Fixes
---------
* A correctly filled grid with revealed letters is noted as solved instead
  of displaying the message
    "The puzzle is completely filled, but some letters are incorrect."
* "Reveal letter" and "Reveal word" now reveal squares if they are blank
  or incorrect (previously they only revealed incorrect squares).
* The "Check while typing" option does not attempt to check squares if the
  puzzle is scrambled.  If this option is selected when the puzzle is
  unscrambled, the puzzle is immediately checked for incorrect letters.
* "Move to next square" and "Move to next blank" preferences under the
  "After entering a letter" section now work as expected.
* All preferences now update immediately when then are changed (so you can
  preview the changes in the main window).
* Removed the pencil color setting until a pencil is implemented.
* Notepad window can *always* be opened or closed.
* Loading and saving the LTIM section of puz files is aware of whether
  or not the timer is running.

Misc
----
* Changed the name of the "Options" dialog to "Preferences".
* The default "crossing clue background color" is now white.


----------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.2.1 (bug fix) (10/14/2009)
====================================
* Fixed timer starting/stopping issues when activating and deactivating
  XWord.
* Notepad window can be closed.
* The grid is replaced with a "(Paused)" message if the timer is running
  when XWord is deactivated.


----------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.2 (10/09/2009)
========================
* Rebus puzzles can now be solved!
* Scrambled puzzles are checked once the puzzle is completely filled.
* "Corrupted" .puz files with the wrong version string are automatically
  tested with other version strings.
* Puzzle information sections (clue prompt, author, title, and copyright)
  are now centered instead of left- and top-aligned.  This will be
  configurable in the future.
* Puzzle title is displayed in the title bar.

File Locations
--------------
* XWord will now search a set of directories for its files rather than
  expecting all the files to be in the executable directory.  Directories
  searched depend both on the OS used and the directory that XWord is run
  from.
* Portable mode: if a file named "config.ini" is found in the executable's
  directory (linux or windows), XWord will write all config settings to
  that file and will not touch any other folders.

Config
------
* Added configuration settings!
* Created a very basic options dialog with wxFormBuilder
* Config file is named "config.ini" on windows and ".xword" on linux

Windows-specific
----------------
* Removed icons from menus, as menu icon rendering is not implemented well
  in wxWidgets under Vista


----------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.1 (07/31/2009)
========================
* Initial release
