XWord - A cross platform crossword solving program
==================================================

https://sourceforge.net/projects/wx-xword/

XWord is a cross-platform crossword puzzle program designed to be highly
configurable.  It reads and writes the Across Lite .puz file format, and reads
the Across Lite plain text format (version 1 or 2).

Supported features:
    - Solving of all American style and cryptic crosswords (not diagramless yet).
    - A timer.
    - Checking and revealing letters.
    - Scrambling and unscrambling puzzle solutions.
    - Viewing and editing puzzle notes.
    - Zooming the grid in and out.
    - Displaying puzzles with rebus information (multiple letters numbers or
        symbols per square).  XWord cannot currently be used to solve rebus
        puzzles, though support for solving rebus puzzles will come in the
        near future.
    - Rearranging the window layout (try checking the "Layout" option in the
        Layout menu)


Configuration is currently minimal, but that will change soon.



XWord can also be used to batch convert .txt formatted puzzles into .puz files
on the command line.  Usage is as follows:

    -c --convert

        Runs XWord in batch convert mode.  XWord will convert files and exit
        (no gui).  Other switches do nothing unless -c is specified.
        With no other switches, convert .txt files and place converted .puz
        files in the same directory.

    -o  --output-files

        If converting files, specify each output file after each input file:
            xword -c -o in_file_1 out_file_1 in_file_2 out_file_2

    -w  --overwrite

        If output files exist, overwrite them instead of creating a new file.
        If this switch is not specified and the output file exists, XWord will
        add a number to the output file name.

    -d  --directory=<output directory>

        Place converted files in this directory.  Output files can be specified
        as relative paths, in which case files will be made relative to this
        directory.

NB: Batch converting is still experimental.  Essentially the program will
    convert all files and then suppress the GUI (forcing the application to end
    with an error).  No information is output to the screen informing the user
    about the converting process.





Building XWord
==============

XWord uses the wxWidgets cross-platform toolkit (version 2.8.10 as of this
writing).  The distributed builds are statically linked and use unicode.  If you
want to build a non-unicode version of XWord, you will get a couple of errors,
because of a few unicode-specific functions and parameters.  These should be
easy to fix.

Currently there is a small amount of code that uses boost (specifically, the
BOOST_FOREACH macro).  Hopefully this will change soon, since it's silly to
require boost for the eight or so lines of code that use the macro.

Visual C++ and Code::Blocks project files are supplied in the source
distribution.  The Code::Blocks file is intended to work only on Linux (i.e. it
uses the wx-config program).


Windows-specific building instructions
======================================

The VC project file is set up to link to the MSVC runtime library *statically*
(so that XWord can be run on Windows without needing to download any dlls).
You will either need to build the wxWidgets libraries so that they also link to
the MSVC runtimes statically, or change the setting
(Properties >> C/C++ >> Code Generation >> Runtime Library).

XWord requires the following libraries in addition to the wxWidgets Base and
Core libraries:

wxAUI
wxpng
wxzlib
