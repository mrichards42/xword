XWord - A cross platform crossword solving program
==================================================

https://sourceforge.net/projects/wx-xword/

XWord is a cross-platform crossword puzzle program designed to be highly
configurable.  It reads multiple puzzle file formats.

Supported features:
    - Solving of all American style, cryptic, and diagramless crosswords.
    - Solving rebus puzzles.
    - Solving puzzles with a variety of tricks, e.g. diagonal clues, arbitrary
      numbering schemes, shaded squares.
    - Support for reading number of puzzle formats:
        - Across Lite
        - XPF
        - jpz
        - ipuz (partial)
    - Recovery of corrupted Across Lite .puz files.
    - A timer.
    - Checking and revealing letters.
    - Scrambling and unscrambling puzzle solutions (for Across Lite files).
    - Viewing puzzle notes.
    - Zooming the grid in and out.
    - Rearranging the window layout.
    - Color, font, and solving behavior configuration.
    - Printing

XWord is extensible via the lua scripting language.  A number of plugins are
available.  See Tools > Package Manager.


Diagramless Puzzles
===================
XWord allows the user to solve diagramless puzzles similarly to normal puzzles
with the exception that black squares are allowed to be selected. When
selected, black squares are outlined in the focused square color.
To make a white square black, type a period (".").  To make a black square
white, type a period or enter another letter.

XWord provides some guidance when solving diagramless puzzles: clue numbers
in the grid are automatically calculated when a square is made black or white.
Numbers in the grid that do not appear in the clue list are highlighted in red.
Naturally, this automatic calculation of grid numbers only works if the puzzle
follows the normal rules of numbering a grid.


Building XWord
==============

XWord uses the wxWidgets cross-platform toolkit (version 2.8.10 as of this
writing).  The distributed builds are statically linked and use unicode.  If you
want to build a non-unicode version of XWord, you will get a couple of errors,
because of a few unicode-specific functions and parameters.  These should be
easy to fix.

http://www.wxwidgets.org

XWord uses a number of other statically or dynamically linked libraries. Most
of these are supplied in the source distribution.  The external libraries
you'll want are wxLua (required for buildling XWord with lua support) and
cURL (if you want to build luacurl, which is needed for many of the lua
scripts).

XWord uses lua as a scripting extension language.  If you don't want to include
lua, undefine XWORD_USE_LUA.  Odds are that there are a few modifications that
will be needed for this option, though regenerating the makefiles using premake
might be enough.


Visual C++ project files and gnu makefules are supplied in the source
distribution.  I haven't built XWord on linux in a while, so the makefiles
probably don't work.

XWord requires the following libraries in addition to the wxWidgets Base and
Core libraries:

wxAUI
wxpng
wxzlib


Windows-specific building instructions
======================================

The VC project file is set up to link to the MSVC runtime library dynamically.
You will either need to build the wxWidgets libraries so that they also link to
the MSVC runtimes dynamically (the default), or change the setting
(Properties >> C/C++ >> Code Generation >> Runtime Library).

The VC project file assumes that you have an environmental variable $(WXWIN)
that points to the wxWidgets folder (with compiled Unicode and Unicode Debug
libraries).
