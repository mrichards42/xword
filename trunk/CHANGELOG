Version 0.3 (??/??/???)
    New Features
    * If a puzzle file is corrupt and not entirely unrecoverable, an option is
      given to load the puzzle anyway.
    * A dialog supporting batch conversion of puzzle files (from .txt to .puz
      and vice-versa) has been added under the tools menu.  If the
      -convert [-c] command line option is given when XWord is invoked, only
      the conversion dialog appears.  Closing the dialog ends the program.
      Files to convert can still be given as command line parameters, and other
      options (-directory [-d], -output-files [-o], -overwrite [-w]) work as
      expected. If XWord is invoked with -c, conversion begins immediately.
    * Added a clue prompt format preference.
    * Added separate preferences for grid clue number and text fonts.
    * Added an option to tweak the proprtion of text size to clue number size
      in the grid.
    * Rudimentary printing.
    * Added "Swap across and down" under the tools menu for a new perspective
      on your crossword puzzle!

    Bug Fixes
    * A correctly filled grid with revealed letters is noted as solved instead
      of displaying the message
        "The puzzle is completely filled, but some letters are incorrect."
    * "Reveal letter" and "Reveal word" now reveal squares if they are blank
      or incorrect (previously they only revealed incorrect squares).
    * The "Check while typing" option does not attempt to check squares if the
      puzzle is scrambled.  If this option is selected when the puzzle is
      unscrambled, the puzzle is immediately checked for incorrect letters.
    * "Move to next square" and "Move to next blank" preferences under the
      "After entering a letter" section now work as expected.
    * All preferences now update immediately when then are changed (so you can
      preview the changes in the main window).
    * Removed the pencil color setting until a pencil is implemented.
    * Notepad window can *always* be opened or closed.
    * Loading and saving the LTIM section of puz files is aware of whether
      or not the timer is running.

    Misc
    * Changed the name of the "Options" dialog to "Preferences".
    * The default "crossing clue background color" is now white.

Version 0.2.1 (bug fix) (10/14/2009)
    * Fixed timer starting/stopping issues when activating and deactivating
      XWord.
    * Notepad window can be closed.
    * The grid is replaced with a "(Paused)" message if the timer is running
      when XWord is deactivated.

Version 0.2 (10/09/2009)
    * Rebus puzzles can now be solved!
    * Scrambled puzzles are checked once the puzzle is completely filled.
    * "Corrupted" .puz files with the wrong version string are automatically
      tested with other version strings.
    * Puzzle information sections (clue prompt, author, title, and copyright)
      are now centered instead of left- and top-aligned.  This will be
      configurable in the future.
    * Puzzle title is displayed in the title bar.

    File Locations
    * XWord will now search a set of directories for its files rather than
      expecting all the files to be in the executable directory.  Directories
      searched depend both on the OS used and the directory that XWord is run
      from.
    * Portable mode: if a file named "config.ini" is found in the executable's
      directory (linux or windows), XWord will write all config settings to
      that file and will not touch any other folders.

    Config
    * Added configuration settings!
    * Created a very basic options dialog with wxFormBuilder
    * Config file is named "config.ini" on windows and ".xword" on linux

    Windows-specific
    * Removed icons from menus, as menu icon rendering is not implemented well
      in wxWidgets under Vista
