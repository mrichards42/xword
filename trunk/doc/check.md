Checking and Revealing the Solution
-----------------------------------

If the solution is not [scrambled](window.html#unscrambling), the user is
allowed to check and reveal answers in the grid.  Using menu items and toolbar
buttons, the user can check or reveal the current letter, word, or the entire
grid.  The user can also reveal only the incorrect letters in the grid.

If the user checks the grid, incorrect letters are show with a red X through
them.  When an incorrect letter is overwritten by any other letter the X is
replaced by a black "flag" (a triangle) in the upper right corner of the square
indicating that the square was checked and found to be incorrect at some point.
When a letter is revealed, it gets a red flag in the upper right corner.  XWord
will not allow the user to overwrite a revealed letter.

### Checking the solution as you type ###

XWord can optionally check the solution automatically, drawing an X through
incorrect letters as you type.  This option can be found on the
[solving](preferences.html#solving_preferences) page of the preferences dialog.


### Checking or revealing a selection ###

To check or reveal a section of the grid, click on `Check Selection...` or
`Reveal Selection...` from the [`Solution`](window.html#solution_menu) menu.
The cursor will turn into crosshairs allowing you to make a selection.  Click
anywhere in the grid to start the selection, drag to make the selection, and
release the mouse to finish the selection.  The selected area will be checked
or revealed.  If you want to cancel the selection, press the `Esc` key.
