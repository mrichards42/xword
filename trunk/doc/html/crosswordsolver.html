<h2>XWord for Crossword Solver Users</h2>
<p>XWord supports <a href="http://www.crosswordsolver.info/">Crossword Solver</a>'s
.jpz format, including the various gimmicks it allows.  XWord provides a
significantly different solving experience (based on Crossword Solver 1.2).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="navigation.html">Grid navigation</a><ul>
<li>Crossword Solver navigates the grid similarly to Across Lite, but doesn't
  respond to <code>HOME</code> and <code>END</code> keys.<br />
  Right click always moves the cursor, and only switches the direction when
  the user clicks on the focused square (left click functions identically).<br />
  Crossword Solver does not provide any customizability in terms of grid
  navigation.<br />
  Crossword Solver does not move the cursor to the first blank when
  switching words.</li>
<li>XWord has roughly the same navigation capabilites and
  customizability as Across Lite.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="diagramless.html">Diagramless</a> puzzles<ul>
<li>Crossword Solver displays black squares in diagramless puzzles as white
  squares filled with ":".</li>
<li>XWord allows interactive solving of diagramless puzzles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="layout.html">Layout</a><ul>
<li>Crossword Solver has a single layout that is not resizable.  Puzzles in
  jpz format can customize the user iterface (e.g. supply a different
  message when the puzzle is complete, disable reveal buttons).</li>
<li>XWord allows the user to position GUI components anywhere and resize them
  to the user's liking.  XWord does not support loading or saving interface
  information in puzzle files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check and reveal<ul>
<li>Crossword Solver allows the user to check the whole grid, or reveal the
  current letter, word, or entire grid.</li>
<li>XWord allows the user to check or reveal the current letter, word, or
  entire grid, and also allows the user to check or reveal a section of
  the grid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pencil<ul>
<li>XWord does not allow users to pencil-in answers.</li>
</ul>
