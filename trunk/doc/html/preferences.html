<h2>Preferences</h2>
<p>The preferences dialog can be opened from the <code>File</code> menu and contains many
sub-categories:</p>
<h3>Solving Preferences</h3>
<p>The Solving prefrences page contains preferences related to grid navigation,
solution checking, the timer, and auto saving.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/solving_prefs.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Strict rebus checking<ul>
<li>If this box is checked, squares with rebus entries for solutions will
  only be counted as correct if the user enters a matching rebus entry.</li>
<li>If this box is unchecked, squares with rebus entries for solutions will
  also be counted as correct if the user enters only the first letter
  of the correct rebus entry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Auto save<ul>
<li>Auto save puzzles (if they are not temporary files) X seconds after the
  last letter was filled into the grid.</li>
<li>Auto save is disabled if this value is 0.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Color Preferences</h3>
<p>The Color prefrences page allows the user to change nearly every color that
XWord uses to display a crossword puzzle.</p>

<ul>
<li>Multi-square selection<ul>

</li>

  entire window</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Font Preferences</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="images/font_prefs.png" /></p>
<p>Note that text is scaled to fit the allotted space in many places, so font
size is irrelevant to several of these font choices:
- Text entered into the grid by the user
- Clue numbers in the grid
- The main clue prompt</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Preferences</h3>
<p>This page contains file history preferences as well as various tweaks.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/misc_prefs.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Clue prompt format<ul>
<li>The clue prompt can be formatted using simple HTML.  "%T" will be
  replaced by the clue text, and "%N" by the clue number.  The default
  centers the clue and includes the clue number.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grid tweaks<ul>
<li>This section allows the user to make minor aesthetic changes to the way
  the grid is presented.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Printing Preferences</h3>
<p>This page allows the user to change grid placement, brightness of the black
squares (to save ink), and to select fonts to be used for printing.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/printing_prefs.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Fonts<ul>
<li>If Use custom fonts is not checked, the appropriate values from the font
  preferences page will be used for printing.</li>

</li>
<li>Black square brightness<ul>

  to 255 (white).</li>
