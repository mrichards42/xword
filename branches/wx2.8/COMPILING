Compiling XWord with XCode3 on a Mac

----------------------------------------
Build wxWidgets
----------------------------------------

Download wxMac from
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxwindows/wxMac-2.8.12.tar.gz
(XWord is currently using wxWidgets 2.8.12.  Newer versions *might* work,
but haven't been tested)

Unzip to a folder.  I'll pretend you unzipped to /Developer/wxMac-2.8.12

    $ cd /Developer/wxMac-2.8.12
    $ mkdir build-release
    $ cd build-release

(Optional)
    Copy files in trunk/wxpatches to their respective locations in
    /Developer/wxMac...
    These files are improvements/changes to wxAUI for XWord

If building on snow leopard, tell it to build 32-bit
    $ arch_flags="-arch i386"
    $ ../configure --enable-unicode --disable-shared CFLAGS="$arch_flags" CXXFLAGS="$arch_flags" CPPFLAGS="$arch_flags" LDFLAGS="$arch_flags" OBJCFLAGS="$arch_flags" OBJCXXFLAGS="$arch_flags"
    $ make

Build the debug release too (the XWord configure script needs both builds for now)
    $ cd ..
    $ mkdir build-debug
    $ cd build-debug
    $ ../configure --enable-unicode --disable-shared --enable-debug CFLAGS="$arch_flags" CXXFLAGS="$arch_flags" CPPFLAGS="$arch_flags" LDFLAGS="$arch_flags" OBJCFLAGS="$arch_flags" OBJCXXFLAGS="$arch_flags"
    $ make



----------------------------------------
Build XWord
----------------------------------------
XWord uses premake to generate project files.  Premake for mac is already included in the distribution.  You can also download the most recent beta here:

http://industriousone.com/premake/download

Unzip premake4 to xword/trunk

    $ cd xword/trunk
    $ ./premake4 --wx-prefix="/Developer/wxMac-2.8.12" xcode3

(If you actually unzipped wxMac there, the configure script will find it without having to add --wx-prefix)

(Previously there were images, etc. to copy, and also some magic that needed to happen to get XWord to know where to find the dylibs.  That's all automated now!)
